## TEST -- NOT FOR PRODUCTION -- 
I'm figuring out how to use Git. I anticipate lots of mistakes to be made along the way. Expect to see best practices not followed as I figure out branching / merging , etc.  

As for the actual code -- I found @Bstrutt's OCR-script to be a good starting place for my intended purposes.

# OCR-Script
Powershell script forked from @Bstrutt to convert a PDF to a PNG then read it through Tesseract-OCR into a text file.

# Dependancies
tesseract.exe
magick.exe (from ImageMagick)
